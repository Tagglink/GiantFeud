# GiantFeud
Two villages have come into conflict, and each have a giant loyal to their cause. Arm your giant with sword and armor, and make sure he is well fed! Lest he fall to the giant of the enemy village.

The game is in Swedish.

I made this game together with [Nershahof](https://github.com/Nershahof) in high school.

## How to Play
Press tiles to send out villagers and gather resources.

Your current resources are visible at the top of the left sidebar.

Use the three item menus to craft new items.

You can see the cost of an item in the bottom left, when hovering your mouse over an item icon.

**Important (and BS) mechanic:** Building a weapon of a new type will completely replace your current weapon, but building a weapon of the same type will **double the effect of the current weapon**.

May the strongest village win!
